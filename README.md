# Nep-SmartSchduler
This project was developed and demoed during the MyAnatome Hackathon using the SandBoxPro code editor/environment. The hackathon entry demonstrates a complete DEMO Mode workflow (frontend + mock backend) so judges and reviewers can test UI flows, data management, and simulated timetable generation without external dependencies.
